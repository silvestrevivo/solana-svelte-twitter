## Anchor Setup

You need to have Cargo and Rust installed to build the contract. First of all, clone the repo and run `yarn install` to add all the dependencies to the Anchor application. Make sure that you have Solana locally in `localhost` and change all the **`devnet`** references to `localhost`. Once that is done, to `build` and `deploy` locally the project run the next command:

```
anchor localnet
```

This command is going to generate the `idl json` file responsible to communicate with the **rpc** from Solana.

## Frontend setup

Frontend is build with SvelteKit. To run it on `localhost:3000`

```
cd app
npm install
npm run dev
```
